From 0.92 release or SVN rev.224 ExtPascal supports an Embedded (or Internal) Web Server mode. This mode makes unnecessary to install and configure Apache/IIS, but you lose the flexibility and facilities that the Apache/IIS server can offer through its modules.

= Steps =

Because this mode works on Windows only, you will need:

1. Delphi (7..2009).

2. Follow the *First Steps* on GettingStarted page.

3. Download [http://www.indyproject.org Indy 10] [http://www.indyproject.org/downloads/10/indy10.0.52_source.zip sources].

4. Update Delphi *Search Path* (menu: Project/Options/Directories/Defines) to point Indy sources.

5. Add a new define *WEBSERVER* on *Conditional defines* entry (menu: Project/Options/Directories/Defines).

6. Build all.

7. Install ExtJS at folder *ext* below the folder of ExtPascalSamples.exe.

8. Start ExtPascalSamples.

9. In your browser call Samples using: `http://localhost` Port 80 is default but can to be changed. Other Web Servers must be disabled on your machine.
