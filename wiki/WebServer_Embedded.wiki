ExtPascal also supports an embedded (or internal) Web server mode. When an ExtPascal application is compiled with an embedded Web server, you don't have to install and configure a Web server such as Apache or IIS to run the app, although you lose the flexibility and facilities that an Apache or IIS server can offer via its modules.
*CAUTION: The embedded Web server mode is experimental and is not actively tested or supported. Bugs and instabilities may be present...*

= Steps =

Here are the steps for compiling the example app with an embedded Web server:

1. Follow the *First Steps* on GettingStarted page.

2. Download the *Indy 10* source code, if needed.

 [http://www.indyproject.org Indy project]

 [http://www.indyproject.org/downloads/10/indy10.0.52_source.zip Delphi source]

 [http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Components_and_Code_examples FPC source]

Note that Delphi 2006 and later already includes Indy 10.

3. Open *ExtPascalSamples3.dpr* with Delphi or open *ExtPascalSamples3_embedded.lpi* with Lazarus.

  * With Delphi, choose Project | Options.
    # On the Compiler tab, check "Assignable typed constants".
    # On the Directories/Conditionals tab, enter the path to Indy in "Search path".
    # On the same tab, enter WEBSERVER in "Conditional defines".

  * With Lazarus, choose Project | Compiler Options and change Other Unit Files to point to Indy.

4. With Delphi, choose Project | Compile. With Lazarus, choose Run | Build.

5. Copy the ExtJS folder below the folder where the ExtPascalSamples3 executable file is located. Make sure the ExtJS folder is named *ext* for this example.

6. Start ExtPascalSamples3.

7. Start a Web browser and enter `http://localhost/Home`

Port 80 is used in this example. Other Web servers must be disabled on your machine if they're using port 80.
