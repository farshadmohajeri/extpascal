= Introduction =

ExtPascal is an another ExtJS wrapper. ExtPascal lets you use the ExtJS from Object Pascal commands issued by the server. That brings the structure and strict syntax of the Object Pascal for programming the web browser. 

The main advantages are:

 * Use your preferred language (in this case Object Pascal) and where you are more productive instead of using JavaScript.
 * Use of native and compiled code with a strongly typed language. That is, many errors are directly appointed by the compiler, without waste time testing in the browser.
 * Use of the editor's intellisense, available in moderns IDEs (Delphi/Lazarus) more productivity in the coding.
 * Centering the programming on the server, where JavaScript is generated dynamically, makes development easier and less dispersed.
 * The business rules can be encapsulated in the server, in Object Pascal, instead of being visible in JavaScript.

= Prerequisites =

 * One Windows, Linux, MacOS X or FreeBSD machine. I tested using Intel/AMD 32 bits, but should work with other processors supported by FreePascal.
 * A web browser: IE 5+, Firefox 1.5+, Safari 2+, Opera 9+ or compatibles.   
 * Download and install Apache 2.2.8 or later, but Apache 1.3 and IIS works using CGIGateway included in ExtPascal package.
 * For native FastCGI operation download and install [http://www.fastcgi.com FastCGI for   Apache 2.2]. For FastCGI thru CGIGateway none extra configuration on Apache is necessary.
 * Download ExtJS 2.1 or later, _*with the documentation*_.
 * Install ExtJS below Apache's Document Root at folder *ext*
 * For Windows install Delphi (5, 6, 7, Turbo, 2006 or 2007) or FreePascal 2.3.1 with Lazarus 0.9.24+ or [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mseide-msegui MSEide 1.8+]. I used Turbo Delphi.
 * For other Posix systems (Linux, MacOS X, BSDs, etc.) install FreePascal 2.3.1 with Lazarus 0.9.24+ or MSEide 1.8+. I used FreePascal and MSEide.
 * Download ExtPascal package to a working directory, for example: C:\ExtPascal. 

= First Steps =
 # Compile ExtToPascal.dpr source using your ObjectPascal compiler.
 # For FreePascal I recommend `-Smdcghie50 -venwi -l` as compiler options. Append this options `-O2pPENTIUM4 -CXpPENTIUM4 -XXsi -CfSSE` to release version.
 # Run it informing the path of the ExtJS documentation, the HTML files. For example: ExtToPascal C:\Ext\docs\output
 # ExtToPascal will generate a Pascal Unit for each JavaScript Package. A total of 12 units in version 2.1 of ExtJS.
 # Compile ExtPascalSamples as example.

= Setting using FastCGI thru CGI gateway (any Apache version and similar procedure on IIS) =
 # Open CGIGateway.dpr
 # Modify Port optional parameter if necessary, default 2014
 # Compile
 # Copy CGIGateway.exe to cgi-bin directory
 # Copy your FastCGI application (by example ExtPascalSamples.exe) to cgi-bin directory
 # Rename CGIGateway.exe to the same name of your FastCGI application changing the extension to .cgi or anything
 # To play the Samples, by example, will have this files at cgi-bin:
{{{
ExtPascalSamples.exe // The real FastCGI application
ExtPascalSamples.cgi // The CGI Gateway
}}}
 # None configuration is necessary on Apache.
 # In your browser call Samples using: `http://localhost/cgi-bin/ExtPascalSamples.cgi`

= Setting using native FastCGI only for Apache 2.2+ =
 # Download FastCGI module at: http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/mod_fastcgi-2.4.6-AP22.dll
 # Rename to “mod_fastcgi.so” 
 # Copy to Apache's modules folder (by example c:\apache\modules)
 # In httpd.conf file at LoadModules session insert the line below:
{{{
LoadModule fastcgi_module modules/mod_fastcgi.so
}}}
 # Declare the FastCGI application as external server, appending this line in httpd.conf:
{{{
fastcgiexternalserver <path to/ExtPascalApp.exe> –host localhost:2014 –idle-timeout 3
}}}
 * <paths to> must be the complete path to FastCGI application, using Apache patterns or a alias (see Apache docs).
 * –host parameter declare the server where is hosted the FastCGI application (by example localhost). Se for na mesma máquina declara-se localhost. Se for em outra declara-se o FQDN da máquina ou o endereço IP.
 * The default TCP/IP port is 2014, but another could be declared.
 * See [http://www.fastcgi.com/mod_fastcgi/docs/mod_fastcgi.html#FastCgiExternalServer FastCGI docs] for more info.
