===How to debug an ExtPascal application in Object Pascal?===
If you want to debug your ExtPascal application using Delphi/Lazarus/MSEide, it's very
simple. Put a break point somewhere in the code, in Home method by example. Then run your ExtPascal application from within IDE using debug mode. Open the browser and hit the URL address. If everything works fine, then the IDE will hold on the breakpoint. From there you could do whatever you need, run step by step, watching values, etc. During debugging, you
may forget the browser output because it should be off due the
response time out. But, your ExtPascal application is still running.

===How to catch JavaScript errors?===
Requisites:
  #. Use Firefox to test your application.
  #. Compile your application using DEBUGJS conditional define. This define formats the JavaScript code making it easier to read and enables an ExtPascal window to capture errors in Ajax.

When an Ajax error occurs, ExtPascal automatically catch this error showing the JavaScript code, the message error and attempts to calculate the line number of the error within the window.

If the error occurs in a normal response (non-Ajax) Firefox shows a blank page, in this case press Ctrl+Shift+J to show the error console window, then click on the error link to see the JavaScript code.

For more resources to catch errors install Firebug. 
 
===How to catch Ajax errors?===
Override TExtThread.OnError method.

==How to use the refresh button of the browser?===

In the beginning of Home method use:

{{{
procedure TMySession.Home; begin
  if not NewThread then begin <<< The Refresh button was pressed?
    Refresh;                  <<< Accept Browser Refresh freeing ExtPascal Objects
    NonExtObjects.Free;       <<< Free non ExtPascal Objects
  end;
  NonExtObjects := TNonExtObjects.Create; <<<< Create non ExtPascal Objects
  [: : :More code: : : : :]
end; 
}}}

===How to send all fields from several forms to server using Ajax?===
For example: 
{{{
Handler := AjaxForms(Server.Method, [AForm1, AForm2]);
}}}
Then all form values are serialized to server by the ExtJS framework itself. You don't need to parse manually on server side because all values are in the common name=value format
within the POST request content.

===How to mix HTML and ExtPascal?===

Using the Html property of TExtPanel and subclasses.
For example: 
{{{
  with TExtPanel.Create do begin
    RenderTo := 'body';
    Html     := '<table><td><a href=' + RequestHeader['SCRIPT_NAME'] + '/Proc target=blank><img src=' + ExtPath + '/examples/shared/screens/' + Gif + '.gif /></a></td><td>' + Desc + '</td></table>blabla</a></td></table>';
  end;
}}}

===How to shutdown an ExtPascal application?===

ExtPascal has a specific method to do this, *Shutdown* method. This method requires a password: *extpascal*, that is hardcoded in ExtPascal source. To shutdown ExtPascalSamples3 by example use:
{{{
http://localhost/cgi-bin/ExtPascalSamples3/shutdown?password=extpascal
}}}
