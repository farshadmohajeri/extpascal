Version 0.1.2 (SVN):

- Now using $ExeExt() macro in 'Execute before' Command so platform-specific
  extension doesn't need to be specified with converter name.
- Fixed two bugs related to forming file names with converter's -e switch.
- Added ExtDirect and ExtUxForm to uses in converted app and ExtPascal app
  units.
- Support for TExtUxFormMultiSelect in converter and as a design control.
- Support for automatic generation of SetLibrary calls with controls that
  are not in ext-all.js (for example, TExtUxFormMultiSelect).
- Added MultiSelect example app.
- Added table of ExtPascal equivalents to VCL/LCL controls.


Version 0.1.1 (08-Oct-2009):

- Eliminated use of ExtGlobal unit, which is no longer part of ExtPascal 0.9.7.
- Documentation update: No longer need to patch Lazarus 0.9.28 or later to use 
  design controls.
- Turned off autosize behavior in TExtFormCheckbox design control in Lazarus.
- Minor fix so extp_proj package will compile with FPC 2.3.1. 


Version 0.1.0 (20-Sep-2009):

- Added support for conditional compiling with embedded Web server.


Version 0.0.9 (12-Sep-2009):

- Added TExtFormNumberField, TExtFormDateField, TExtFormTimeField design
  controls to ExtP_Ctrls package.
- Converter now declares form variables in the app's thread class instead of
  as global variables in the form units.
- Support for ReadOnly property where appropriate (TExtFormTextField, etc.).
- Fixed bugs related to conversion and/or defaults for Disabled, Hidden,
  Border and Plain properties.
- Additional preparation for future grid design controls (not yet distributed).
