Ext JS wrapper for Object Pascal

version: 0.9.7, Draw2D initial support, 07-out-2009

ExtPascal is an Ext JS wrapper. 
ExtPascal lets you use the Ext JS from Object Pascal commands issued by the server using FastCGI or FastCGI thru CGI gateway. 
That brings the structure and strict syntax of the Object Pascal for programming the web browser.
